[Intro]
[Verse]
In this city bright, where the neon blinks,
I walk alone, searching for the signs.
Echoes of laughter, a distant sound,
Faint whispers of dreams that used to astound.

[Pre-chorus]
But here I am, in this glowing crowd,
Hoping to find something to hold me round.
Lost in the lights, I wander the streets,
Hoping to catch a glimpse of what’s left.

[Chorus]
Neon dreams echo, fading fast,
Searching for the spark that we once had.
In this city bright, where the neon glows,
I’m chasing shadows, trying to find my way home.

[Verse]
Through the crowded bars, past the flashing screens,
Every face a stranger, every dream unseen.
I search the crowds, hoping to see,
A hint of the life that once was free.

[Pre-chorus]
But here I am, in this glowing crowd,
Hoping to find something to hold me round.
Lost in the lights, I wander the streets,
Hoping to catch a glimpse of what’s left.

[Chorus]
Neon dreams echo, fading fast,
Searching for the spark that we once had.
In this city bright, where the neon glows,
I’m chasing shadows, trying to find my way home.
